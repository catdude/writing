 # writing
Since I want to write on several devices, and at one of them doesn't allow
flash drives (or any other USB storage devices) or Google Drive or Dropbox
connection, this is the next best thing. I'll clone a directory before I 
start working, do my writing, then push the new directory back to Github.
